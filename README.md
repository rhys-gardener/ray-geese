This is a project where I attempted to create an environment in which I could use RLlib (RAY) to train a solution/entry to the Kaggle "Hungry Geese" competition. 

To date, I haven't been able to get a submission working (due to ray.init(args)) taking too long to initiage on the Kaggle submission docker.
